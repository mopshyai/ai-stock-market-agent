## TWITTER/X LAUNCH THREAD

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
I built an AI that scans 100+ stocks every morning and sends me the best setups before market open.

It's been finding consolidations, breakouts, and dip-buys I would've missed manually.

Here's how it works (and why I'm launching it publicly): 🧵

### Tweet 2 (Problem)
The problem: Manually checking charts every day is exhausting.

You either:
- Spend 2 hours scanning
- Use expensive tools with bad UX
- Wing it and miss opportunities

I wanted something dead simple that just *works*.

---

### Tweet 3 (Solution)
So I built this AI Stock Market Agent.

Every morning at market open:
✅ Scans your watchlist (10-100+ stocks)
✅ Detects 4 signal types using technical indicators
✅ Ranks each by AI score (1-8)
✅ Sends top setups to Telegram

Zero manual work.

---

### Tweet 4 (Features)
What it detects:
- 🟢 Consolidation (pre-breakout zones)
- 📉 Buy-the-dip (oversold reversals)
- 🚀 Breakout (resistance breaks)
- 📈 Volume spikes (unusual activity)

Uses: BB, RSI, ADX, ATR, EMA alignment.

---

### Tweet 5 (Dashboard)
It also has a clean web dashboard where you can:
- View all signals
- Filter by score/trend
- See historical scans
- Track performance
- Run scans manually

Built with Python + Streamlit.

**[Attach: screenshot of dashboard features]**

---

### Tweet 6 (Results)
Early results:
- XOM consolidation → +8.4% in 14 days
- AMD volume spike → caught before major move
- NVDA dip signal → reversal confirmed

Not every signal hits, but tracking shows which patterns work best over time.

---

### Tweet 7 (Tech Stack)
Built with:
- Python
- yfinance (market data)
- Pandas (analysis)
- Streamlit (dashboard)
- SQLite (tracking)
- Telegram Bot API

Open to feedback from builders + traders.

## LINKEDIN POST

**Headline:**
Launching: AI Stock Market Agent — Daily market signals delivered automatically

**Body:**
After months of manually scanning stocks every morning, I decided to automate it.

Today I'm launching an AI-powered stock scanner that:

🔍 Scans 100+ stocks daily using technical indicators (Bollinger Bands, RSI, ADX, ATR)
📊 Detects consolidation, breakouts, dip-buys, and volume spikes
🤖 Scores each signal (1-8) based on setup strength
📱 Delivers top opportunities via Telegram before market open
📈 Tracks historical performance to show what works

**The Problem:**
Traders and investors waste hours checking charts. Most miss high-probability setups because life gets busy.

**The Solution:**
An intelligent agent that works 24/7, analyzing the market and sending you only the signals that matter.

**Why I Built This:**
I'm a builder who trades on the side. I needed something simple, systematic, and automated. Existing tools were expensive, complex, or unreliable.

**What's Next:**
I'm opening a free beta. If you want daily signals delivered automatically, drop a comment or DM me.

**Tech Stack:**
Python • Streamlit • yfinance • SQLite • Telegram Bot API
