## PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

### Short Description (260 characters)
An intelligent system that scans 100+ stocks every morning, detects consolidation, breakouts, and buy-the-dip setups, ranks them by AI score, and delivers top opportunities to your phone via Telegram. Track performance. Stay ahead of the market.

### Long Description (Full detail)

**The Problem**

Every day, thousands of stocks move. Breakouts happen. Dips reverse. But you can't watch them all.

Every morning at market open, it:
- **Scans** 10-100+ stocks using advanced technical indicators (Bollinger Bands, RSI, ADX, EMA)
- **Detects** 4 high-probability setups: Consolidation, Breakout, Buy-the-Dip, Volume Spike
- **Scores** each signal from 1-8 (higher = stronger opportunity)
- **Delivers** top signals straight to Telegram on your phone

No manual work. No guessing. Just data-driven signals in your pocket.

## MAKER COMMENT (Post this immediately after launching)

### Template

👋 Hey Product Hunt!

I'm [Your Name], and I built **AI Stock Market Agent** because I was tired of missing trades.

**The backstory:**

Every morning, I'd spend 2 hours scanning charts manually. I'd find setups, but by the time I analyzed them all, the opportunity was gone. Or worse — I'd miss them entirely.

So I built an AI to do the heavy lifting.

**What it does:**

Every morning at 9:30 AM ET (market open), it:
1. Scans 100+ stocks using technical indicators
2. Detects consolidation, breakouts, dips, and volume spikes
3. Ranks them by score (1-8, higher = stronger)
4. Sends the top 3-5 straight to my phone via Telegram

I wake up, check Telegram, and know exactly where to focus.

**Why it's different:**

- **No black box:** You see every indicator, every score, every calculation
- **Self-hosted:** Runs on your machine, your data stays private
- **Open source:** Full transparency, customize anything
- **Actually works:** Built by a trader, for traders (not a dev who Googled "stock APIs")

**What I'd love from you:**

- Feedback on the dashboard (too cluttered? missing features?)
- Ideas for v2 (what indicators would you add?)
- Bug reports (I've tested on Mac, need Windows/Linux feedback)

I'm here all day answering questions. Ask me anything!

And if you try it, I'd love to hear: **What was your first signal?**

Thanks for checking it out! 🚀

[Your Name]
Maker of AI Stock Market Agent

## QUESTIONS YOU'LL GET ASKED (Prepare Answers)

### Q: How is this different from TradingView alerts?
**A:** TradingView requires manual setup for each stock/alert. We automatically scan your entire watchlist daily and rank opportunities by strength. You wake up to a curated list, not 100 alerts to sift through.

### Q: Does it actually work? What's the win rate?
**A:** Signals are based on proven technical indicators. We're building historical tracking so you can see performance over time. Not every signal wins (no system does), but it helps you focus on higher-probability setups instead of random picks.

### Q: Is it free?
**A:** Yes, it's open-source and self-hosted. You run it on your machine, so there's no subscription. Optional paid hosting + managed service coming soon for non-technical users.

### Q: Do I need to code?
**A:** For basic use, no. Just configure tickers in a YAML file and run it. The dashboard is point-and-click. Advanced customization requires Python knowledge.

### Q: What data does it use?
**A:** Yahoo Finance via the yfinance library. Free, reliable, covers US stocks, ETFs, crypto, and forex.

### Q: Can it trade automatically?
**A:** No. It only sends signals. You make all trading decisions. We're not building an auto-trader (legal/regulatory reasons).

### Q: Does it work for crypto?
**A:** Yes! BTC, ETH, and other major coins work if they're on Yahoo Finance.

### Q: How do I install it?
**A:** Clone the repo, install Python dependencies, configure your tickers, run the scan. Full guide in the README. Takes about 10 minutes.

### Q: Will you add [feature]?
**A:** Probably! What are you thinking? (Then engage with their idea)

## ENGAGEMENT TACTICS

### Get More Upvotes

1. **Upvote other launches** (they'll return the favor)
2. **Comment thoughtfully** on similar products
3. **Use your network** (email, Slack, Discord, Twitter)
4. **Post updates** ("Just hit #5! Help us reach top 3!")
5. **Engage every commenter** (reply fast = more visibility)

### Avoid These Mistakes

❌ Asking for upvotes directly ("Please upvote!")
❌ Spamming groups with launch link
❌ Ignoring negative feedback
❌ Being defensive in comments
❌ Posting once and disappearing

### Do This Instead

✅ Ask for "feedback" and "support"
✅ Share organically ("Launched on PH today, excited to hear thoughts!")
✅ Thank negative feedback ("Great point, we'll add that to v2")
✅ Stay humble ("Still learning, appreciate the input!")
✅ Engage all day (maker presence = more upvotes)

## HUNTER SELECTION (Optional)

**Should you get a hunter?**

Hunters are PH users with big followings who "hunt" (post) your product. They can boost initial visibility.

**Pros:**
- More initial upvotes
- Credibility boost
- Reach their audience

**Cons:**
- You're not listed as "Maker" (you're "Made by")
- Less authentic feel
- Harder to engage

**Recommendation:**
Self-launch for authenticity. You built it, you should launch it. Tag yourself as Maker.
