## PROBLEM SECTION

### Headline
**The Problem: You're Flying Blind**

### Copy
Every day, thousands of stocks move. Breakouts happen. Dips reverse. Opportunities flash and disappear.

But you can't watch them all.

**You're stuck with:**
- ❌ Manually checking charts (time-consuming)
- ❌ Missing early signals (too late to enter)
- ❌ Emotional decision-making (no system)
- ❌ Information overload (which stocks matter?)

**What if an AI did the heavy lifting for you?**

---

## SOLUTION SECTION

### Headline
**Meet Your AI Stock Market Agent**

### Copy
An intelligent system that works 24/7 to find your next opportunity.

Every morning at market open, it:
1. **Scans** the market using proven technical indicators
2. **Detects** consolidation, breakout, dip-buying, and volume spike setups
3. **Scores** each signal from 1-8 (highest = strongest opportunity)
4. **Delivers** the top opportunities straight to Telegram

**No manual work. No guessing. Just data-driven signals in your pocket.**

## HOW IT WORKS

### Step 1: AI Scans the Market
Advanced algorithms analyze price action, volume, volatility, and trend strength across your watchlist using:
- Bollinger Bands
- RSI (momentum)
- ADX (trend strength)
- EMA alignment (trend direction)
- Volume analysis

### Step 2: Signals Are Ranked
Every stock gets a Signal Score (0-8) based on:
- 🟢 **Consolidation** (low volatility before breakout) → +1
- 📉 **Buy-the-Dip** (oversold with reversal potential) → +2
- 🚀 **Breakout** (price breaking resistance) → +3
- 📈 **Volume Spike** (unusual activity) → +1
- ⬆️ **Uptrend** (EMA alignment) → +1

### Step 3: Alerts Delivered
Top signals sent to:
- 📱 **Telegram** (instant mobile push)
- 💬 **Slack** (team channels)
- 📧 **Email** (daily digest)

### Step 4: Track Performance
Built-in analytics show:
- Historical signal performance
- Win rates by signal type
- Top-performing patterns
- Your personal trading edge
