## TWITTER/X STRATEGY

### Launch Day Thread (Main Announcement)

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
```
I spent 2 hours every morning scanning stocks.

I missed breakouts. Made emotional trades. Lost opportunities.

So I built an AI to do it for me.

Today, I'm open-sourcing it. 🧵
```

**Tweet 2 (Problem)**
```
The problem with trading:

• 1000s of stocks move daily
• Can't watch them all
• Miss early signals
• Analysis paralysis

You need a system. But building one takes time you don't have.
```

**Tweet 3 (Solution)**
```
Enter: AI Stock Market Agent

Every morning at 9:30 AM, it:
- Scans 100+ stocks
- Detects consolidation, breakouts, dips
- Scores each setup (1-8)
- Sends top 3 to my phone

No manual work. Just signals in Telegram.

[Screenshot: Dashboard]
```

**Tweet 4 (How It Works)**
```
How it works:

1️⃣ AI scans using technical indicators
   • Bollinger Bands
   • RSI
   • ADX
   • Volume analysis

2️⃣ Detects 4 signal types
   • 🟢 Consolidation
   • 📉 Buy-the-Dip
   • 🚀 Breakout
   • 📈 Volume Spike

[Screenshot: Signal table]
```

**Tweet 5 (Scoring)**
```
3️⃣ Every stock gets a score (1-8)

Higher score = stronger signal

Example:
• AMD: Score 7 🔥 (Breakout + Volume + Uptrend)
• AAPL: Score 3 ⭐ (Consolidation only)

You focus on the 🔥s.

[Screenshot: Scores column]
```

**Tweet 6 (Delivery)**
```
4️⃣ Top signals delivered to Telegram

I wake up. Check my phone. Know where to focus.

No more:
❌ 2-hour morning routine
❌ Missed opportunities
❌ Emotional decisions

Just data-driven setups.

[Screenshot: Telegram alert]
```

**Tweet 7 (Tracking)**
```
5️⃣ Built-in performance tracking

Every scan stored in a database.

See:
• Historical signals
• What patterns work
• Win rates over time

You're not guessing. You're improving.

## LINKEDIN STRATEGY

### Professional Launch Post

```
**I built an AI to solve my biggest trading problem**

For years, I spent 2+ hours every morning scanning stocks manually.

I'd find setups, but analysis took so long that opportunities would close before I could act. Or worse — I'd miss them entirely.

So I built a system to automate the heavy lifting.

**What it does:**

Every morning at market open, an AI agent:
• Scans 100+ stocks using proven technical indicators
• Detects consolidation, breakout, dip, and volume spike setups
• Scores each opportunity from 1-8 based on strength
• Delivers the top 3-5 signals to my phone via Telegram

I wake up. Check Telegram. Know exactly where to focus.

**Why I'm sharing this:**

Because I know I'm not alone in this struggle.

If you trade or invest, you've felt the pain of:
❌ Information overload
❌ Missed opportunities
❌ Emotional decision-making without a system

**The tool is now open-source.**

• Self-hosted (runs on your machine, your data stays private)
• Fully customizable (choose your tickers, adjust thresholds)
• No subscription required
• Built with Python, Streamlit, and Telegram

**Try it here:** [link]

**Launching on Product Hunt:** [link]

I'd love to hear your feedback. And if you try it, drop a comment with your first signal — I'm genuinely curious what the AI finds for different watchlists.

P.S. — Not financial advice. This is an analysis tool. All trading decisions are your responsibility.

## REDDIT STRATEGY

### r/algotrading Post

**Title:** [Project] Open-sourced my AI stock scanner — daily signals delivered to Telegram

**Body:**
```
Hey r/algotrading,

I built a tool that scans stocks every morning and sends signals to Telegram. Today I'm open-sourcing it.

**What it does:**
- Scans 10-100+ stocks using technical indicators (BB, RSI, ADX, volume)
- Detects 4 pattern types: consolidation, breakout, buy-the-dip, volume spike
- Scores each from 1-8
- Sends top opportunities to Telegram/Slack

**Tech stack:**
- Python
- yfinance (data)
- ta (indicators)
- Streamlit (dashboard)
- SQLite (historical tracking)
- Telegram API

**Why I built this:**
I was spending 2 hours every morning manually scanning. Built this to automate the grunt work.

**GitHub:** [link]
**Live demo:** [link to dashboard or video]

**Looking for:**
- Feedback on indicator logic
- Ideas for additional signals
- Bug reports (tested on Mac, need Windows feedback)

Happy to answer questions about the implementation.

P.S. — It's educational/analysis only. Not financial advice. You make all trading decisions.

### r/stocks or r/investing Post (Careful - some subs ban self-promotion)

**Title:** Made a free tool that finds stock setups and sends them to your phone

**Body:**
```
Not sure if this belongs here (mods, remove if not), but I built a tool that might help some of you.

**Problem:** Too many stocks to watch, too little time to analyze them all.

**Solution:** AI scans them for you every morning and sends the best setups to Telegram.

It looks for:
- Consolidation (low volatility before breakout)
- Breakouts (price clearing resistance)
- Buy-the-dip (oversold bounces)
- Volume spikes (unusual activity)

**How to use:**
1. Install (takes 10 minutes)
2. Add your watchlist
3. Get signals every morning

It's open-source, self-hosted, and free.

Link: [GitHub or landing page]

## HACKER NEWS POST

### Show HN: AI Stock Market Agent — Daily signals delivered to Telegram

**Body:**
```
Hey HN,

I'm a trader/developer who got tired of spending 2+ hours every morning scanning stocks. So I built an AI to do it for me, and today I'm open-sourcing it.

**What it does:**
Every morning at market open, it scans your watchlist using technical indicators (Bollinger Bands, RSI, ADX, volume), detects high-probability setups (consolidation, breakouts, dips, volume spikes), scores them 1-8, and sends the top signals to Telegram.

**Tech:**
- Python (scanning + indicators)
- Streamlit (web dashboard)
- SQLite (historical tracking)
- Telegram API (delivery)
- yfinance (market data)

**Why it might interest you:**
- Self-hosted (data never leaves your machine)
- Fully customizable (adjust thresholds, add indicators)
- Transparent (no ML black box, just proven TA formulas)
- MIT licensed

**GitHub:** [link]

**Demo:** [YouTube link]

**What I learned:**
Building this taught me that most "trading signals" services are just basic TA wrapped in marketing. The hard part isn't the algorithms — it's presenting signals in a way that's actionable (hence the scoring system).

Happy to answer questions about the implementation, indicator logic, or trading in general.

Feedback and PRs welcome.
