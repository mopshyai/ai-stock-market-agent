## FIRST COMMENT (Critical!)

Post this immediately after launch to provide context:

---

**Hey Product Hunt! 👋**

I'm [Your Name], and I built **AI Stock Market Agent** to solve a problem I had as a trader: manually checking charts every morning was exhausting and I kept missing opportunities.

**What it does:**
Every morning at market open, this AI scans 100+ stocks using technical indicators (Bollinger Bands, RSI, ADX, ATR) and sends the best setups straight to Telegram.

**How it works:**
1. Scans your watchlist automatically
2. Detects 4 signal types: consolidation, breakouts, dip-buys, volume spikes
3. Scores each signal 1-8 based on setup strength
4. Delivers top opportunities via Telegram with charts
5. Tracks historical performance to show what works

**Why I built it:**
I trade on the side but don't have time to check 50 charts every day. I wanted something dead simple that just works autonomously.

**Tech stack:**
Python, Streamlit, yfinance, Telegram Bot API, SQLite

**Current status:**
- Fully functional beta
- Running daily scans for early users
- Dashboard + Telegram alerts live
- Performance tracking operational

**What's next:**
- Multi-timeframe analysis (1D + 4H)
- More indicators (MACD, Supertrend)
- Backtesting engine
- Mobile app

**Free beta is open!**
Comment "INTERESTED" or DM me and I'll send you access.

Happy to answer any questions about the tech, trading logic, or results so far! 📈

### Q: Is this open source?

### Q: Does it work for crypto?
**A:** Yes! It works with any ticker supported by Yahoo Finance, including BTC, ETH, and other major cryptocurrencies.

### Q: What's the pricing?

### Q: What happens if a signal is wrong?

## EXAMPLE FIRST COMMENT (Alternative Version)

Hey PH! 👋

I'm launching **AI Stock Market Agent** today.

**The problem:**
Manually scanning charts every morning sucks. You either spend 2 hours doing it or miss opportunities.

**The solution:**
An AI that scans 100+ stocks at market open, detects high-probability setups (consolidation, breakouts, dips, volume spikes), scores them 1-8, and sends the top ones to Telegram.

**Built with:**
Python, Streamlit, yfinance, Telegram Bot API

**Why I built it:**
I trade on the side but don't have time to check 50 charts daily. I wanted a system that runs autonomously and only alerts me when there's something worth reviewing.

**What makes it different:**
- Dead simple (runs in background, zero maintenance)
- Transparent (shows all metrics, not a black box)
- Tracks performance (you can see what works over time)
- Fully customizable (your tickers, your thresholds)

**Current status:**
Beta users are getting daily scans. So far:
- XOM consolidation signal → +8.4% in 14 days
- AMD volume spike → caught before major move
- Average of 2-3 quality signals per day

**Free beta is open** — comment or DM for access!

Happy to answer questions about the tech, trading logic, or results! 📈
